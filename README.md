# BITCOIN-PRICE-PREDICTION-using-LSTM
Bitcoin price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a deep learning approach widely applied to time-series forecasting. Since Bitcoin prices fluctuate continuously and show sequential patterns, LSTM models are effective because they can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in data.
